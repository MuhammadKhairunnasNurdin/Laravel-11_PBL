### **🕙 Project Collaboration:**

---

1. Sync Your Fork repository:

   You can click in middle top right in Your GitHub repository: Laravel_PBL_Pro-Max

2. fetch change from your fork to local remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ``` 
   with this syntax, will update local remote to match updated fork
   if after this not show up which branch that updated, that mean your local remote is updated

3. if fetch is show updated branch:

   go to which branch that updated
   ```bash
   git switch frontend
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git switch backend
   ```
   or
    ```bash
   git switch Other_Branch
   ```

   note: change "Other_Branch" with your branch that existed in origin remote

4. Pull code change in updated branch:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

5. Create your code change

6. Add to staging index your change:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit change:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```

   Note: for conventional commit message you can follow this rule:
   #### Conventional Commit Messages
   See how a [minor change](#examples) to your commit message style can make a difference.

8. Push change to fork related branch that your updated and don't push to master like 'git push origin master', or you blocked by rule (always check branch with steps 3, so push will hit remote branch that role rule targeted):

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

9. Do Pull Request from your fork to main repository to discuss the change with your team:
    - Open your fork in your repository, if in there has notification to compare and pull request hit that button in there
    - Create pull request from your fork to main repository related branch which your updated(like from frontend fork to frontend main)

10. (Optional) if when pull had problem with "merge using **ort** strategy", like merge commit with no actual changes make your work tree dirty, do this:
    ```bash
    git config pull.ff only
    ``` 
    Note: if there is error when pull, because git config pull.ff=only, do this:
     ```bash
     git config pull.rebase false
     ```

### **🗒 Note :**

---

-   If there are update change in your fork, always synced that, because you cannot push and crate pull request without that
-   When Checkout, Push or Pull, always check your git branch is related to your Role
-   Don't push to master with 'git push origin master' when add code change to GitHub
-   Always create Pull request like steps 9
-   if in Discord that connected with webhook had notify about pull request, you can join discussion and review your teams code
